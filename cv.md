Info about me:

I am 19 years old and I have not yet decided on the direction of the IT sphere. I wanted to try Web-Frontend in the hope of gaining experience in large projects and continuing to develop in the direction I liked. I have little experience in real work, so I try to get experience from any task. The 3rd year is already underway at the Faculty of Information Technology and it's time to start working.
